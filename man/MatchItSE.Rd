\title{MatchItSE: methods for Standard Error estimation}
\description{
Contains auxiliary functions for calculating Standard Errors for
matched samples from the MatchIt package. Please note, that Matchit
does not estimate Standard Errors by intention, since matching is seen by the
packageâ€™s authors as a data preprocessing step.
